# MyfirstMircogame
Project title "No walk only jump fps shooter."

The game is an fps shooter with very low gravity and you can only jump hight to move and cannot walk. You must kill 3 turrets and 3 hover bots to win this game.

Open Unity and press play.

I learned that Unity is free and was pretty easy to use minus the camera movement. (The camera movement was worse then tinkercads.) The game sometimes delted my work when i click a turtoiral i had to redo the game 4 times. What worked well was the low gravity effects and the wasy you cant move.
